   - Look for `eth_sendTransaction` or similar calls
   - Transaction should include proper gas and value parameters

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **1. Import Errors (500 Server Error)**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '../hooks/...'
```
**Solution**: File paths have been fixed. Restart the dev server if needed.

#### **2. No Agents Displayed**
**Cause**: No agents in the smart contract
**Solution**: 
- Use the test suite to create a test agent
- Deploy contracts with initial data
- Check contract connection in console

#### **3. Transaction Failures**
**Cause**: Wallet not connected or insufficient funds
**Solution**:
- Connect MetaMask or compatible wallet
- Ensure sufficient ETH for transactions
- Check network (should be on localhost/hardhat)

#### **4. Console Logs Missing**
**Cause**: Browser console not properly opened
**Solution**:
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Navigate to Console tab
- Refresh the page and try interactions again
