## Quick Fix for Authentication Error

The current authentication error is due to missing Privy configuration. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Quick Development Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Sign up for Privy** (Free account)
   - Go to [https://console.privy.io/](https://console.privy.io/)
   - Click "Sign up for free"
   - Verify your email

2. **Create a new app**
   - Click "Create App" or "New App"
   - Name: `Chimera DevMatch Local`
   - Environment: `Development`

3. **Get your App ID**
   - After creating the app, you'll see your `App ID`
   - Copy this ID (looks like: `clxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

4. **Update your environment**
   - Open `/packages/nextjs/.env.local`
   - Replace `your_privy_app_id_here` with your real App ID:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID="clxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

5. **Restart your development server**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

### Option 2: Continue with Limited Functionality

If you want to test the marketplace without authentication:

1. **The app will work** with a warning banner
2. **Smart contract interactions** will still function
3. **UI and navigation** will work normally
4. **Only authentication features** will be disabled

## What the Authentication Enables

- **Google OAuth Login**
- **Automatic Wallet Creation** (no MetaMask needed)
- **Gasless Transactions** via smart accounts
- **User Profile Management**
- **Enhanced Security Features**

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Wagmi Provider**: Now properly configured  
‚úÖ **Smart Contract Hooks**: Will work correctly  
‚úÖ **Marketplace Interface**: Fully functional  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Authentication**: Requires Privy App ID  

## Expected Result

After adding your Privy App ID:
- No more WagmiProvider error
- Clean marketplace interface loads
- Authentication flow works
- All buttons and interactions function properly

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify the App ID is correctly copied (no extra spaces/quotes)
3. Restart the development server after changing .env.local
4. Clear browser cache if needed

The authentication system is now properly configured to handle both development and production scenarios!
